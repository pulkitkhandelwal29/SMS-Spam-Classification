# SMS Spam Classification
<hr>
In this particular project, we are classifying the text as Spam or Ham

Using **Natural Language Processing**

## Data
Data is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection

## Technology
* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning

## Packages
* Nltk (Natural Language toolkit)
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas

## Approach
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Text Cleaning
  * Removal of StopWords and Punctuations
  * Using WordNet Lemmatizer, lemmatized the words
  * Use of TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Concept of Scikit-Learn Pipelining
* Model trained using Naive-Bayes Classifer and SVM (Support Vector Machine)

## Predicting on New Text
Machine Learning Model is able to classify whether the SMS is Spam or Ham, given a text :-

**Text** = 'Congratulations, you have won a lottery of $5000. To Won Text on,555500 '<br>
**Result** :- Spam


## Future Approach
Spam Classification using Deep Learning (RNN)
